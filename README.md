        <h5 style="padding: 40px 80px;">Dear Mr.Moore:
            <div class="splash" style="padding: 5px 8px;font-size: 20px;">
                <p>I am writing to express my enthusiasm in applying for the full-stack web developer position at Boeing
                    Product Support and Services - IT&DA team. I find the prospect of contributing to your team both
                    exciting and in parallel with my professional aspirations.</p>
                <p> During my tenure at ExtraHop Networks, I was responsible for redesigning the main page using HTML and
                    Angular, significantly lowering loading times by 1.3 seconds to improve user experience. My ability
                    to deploy applications using Docker and develop on cloud platforms like AWS aligns me as a strong
                    candidate for creating resilient cloud-native services.</p>
                <p> Notably at Outreach, my work in agile environments has brought measurable improvements in project
                    ROI, mirroring your need for agile development expertise in a global team. I've also led a major
                    project to refine the user interface design, resulting in a 36% upsurge in user engagement across
                    our main product line. This experience honed my proficiency in React and Node.js and instilled a
                    deep appreciation for collaborative innovation in creating intuitive web applications.</p>
                    My tenure as a junior web developer at OfferUp involved working on the redevelopment of a critical
                   application, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction scores by 17%, showcasing my ability to translate
                   technical challenges into tangible improvements.
                  I am drawn to Boeing's commitment to fostering an inclusive work environment. I am confident that my
                  past experience and skills will prove to be a valuable asset to your team. Thank you.
            <br>
                 Sincerely,
                <br>
                Do-yun Kwon</p>
